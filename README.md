# AetherSpeak

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/aetherspeak.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/aetherspeak) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/makalin/aetherspeak.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/makalin/aetherspeak) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/makalin/aetherspeak.svg)](https://github.com/makalin/aetherspeak/graphs/contributors)

AetherSpeak is an open-source, adaptive language protocol designed for efficient communication between AI agents and services. It addresses the inefficiencies of natural languages like English in machine-to-machine interactions by using neural embeddings for semantic nuance and symbolic elements for logical precision. This hybrid approach enables compact data exchange, reducing latency in multi-agent systems while allowing the protocol to self-evolve based on interaction feedback.

## About the Project
Natural languages introduce ambiguity and redundancy in AI-to-AI communication, potentially slowing systems by 2-3x. AetherSpeak solves this with a dynamic protocol that compresses information (e.g., to 1% of original size) while maintaining accuracy for tasks like collaborative reasoning.

### Motivation
- **Why Build This?** To foster scalable AGI ecosystems where agents can interact seamlessly without vendor lock-in.
- **What Problem Does It Solve?** Reduces computational overhead in protocols like natural language summaries.
- **Standout Features**: Self-optimizing grammar, multi-modal support (text/images), noise-resilient coding.

### Built With
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for neural embeddings
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) for symbolic logic
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for interfaces

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up AetherSpeak locally.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/makalin/aetherspeak.git
   cd aetherspeak
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Generate embeddings for AI communication:
```python
from aetherspeak import Encoder

encoder = Encoder()
message = "Collaborate on task X"
embedded = encoder.embed(message)
print(embedded)  # Compact token sequence
```

For full API docs, see [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).
